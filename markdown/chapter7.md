## What is a module?

- Modules allow us to: 
    - organize code for readability and reuse
    - control scope and privacy
    - Contains traits, enums, functions, etc.

## How do you define a module

- You use the ```mod``` keyword for this.

## How can you view the heirarchy of the modules crate?

You can, after installing cargo-modules, can call the following function:

```bash
cargo-modules structure
```

- This will show you the modules, and the functions associated with it.
