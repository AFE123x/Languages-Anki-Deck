# Chapter 1

## What is a vector?

- Some quantities (time, temperature, etc.), can be easily described with a single quantity. 
    - There are also quantities where you need direction.

- Where we need direction, this is known as a **vector quantity**.
- If the vector has the same direction, they're parallel.
- two vectors are equal if they share the same direction and magnitude.
- If two vectors have the same magnitude, but oppositev direction, they negatives of each other.


## Vector sum

- We can find the total magnitude resulting from a sequence of vectors by using the **vector sum**.

$\overrightarrow{C} = \overrightarrow{A} + \overrightarrow{B}$

- We can add this by getting the x, y and z components, adding them together, then getting the angle.

## Unit Vectors

- A Unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of 1.
    - The point is to just describe a direction in space.

## Scalar product

- We denote the scalar product of vectors A and B as $\overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{B}$.

$\overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{A} = ABcos(\phi) = |\overrightarrow{A}||\overrightarrow{B}|cos(\phi)$

- $\phi$ is the angle between A and B.
